The Data is given [here](PricingData.csv).
For our approach to solve problem given in [Problem Statement](Problem Statement.pdf) refer to the Project [Report](DTC4872_D-Wing_report.pdf) and the [Presentation](KDAG_Hackathon.pdf).
To directly get the output file run [PythonFile](DTC4872_D-Wing_code.py).
For visualizing clusters and other metrics used in order to determine them see the [JupyterNotebook](price_setter_and_follower.ipynb).
